<h3 id="use-cases">Use Case - Consumer Access to their Claims Data</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Consumer-directed exchange occurs when a consumer or an authorized caregiver invokes their HIPAA Individual Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524) and requests their digital health information from a HIPAA covered entity (CE) via an application or other third-party data steward.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Technical Workflow</h4>
<p><img style="width: 100%; float: none; align: middle;" src="CARINSequence.png" /> Actors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer (aka Subscriber, Beneficiary, Patient, or Personal Representative)</li>
<li>Consumer App (aka digital third-party application selected by and primarily for the Consumer with a consumer-facing user interface)</li>
<li>Health Plan API (aka Payer, Covered Entity)</li>
<li>Health Plan&rsquo;s Identity and Access Authorization server</li>
</ul>
<p>Flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumer App presents a list of potential Payers / Health Plans that can be accessed by the Consumer.</li>
<li>Consumer selects the Payer / Health Plan.</li>
<li>Consumer App opens the link to the Health Plan's Identity and Access Authorization server.</li>
<li>Consumer enters the credentials.</li>
<li>Health Plan's Identity and Access Authorization server validates the credentials, generates and returns to the Consumer App an OIDC token with Consumer and authorized patient/beneficiary identities encoded.</li>
<li>Consumer App successfully links the user to the Payer / Health Plan and notifies the Consumer.</li>
<li>Consumer requests the Consumer App to fetch Explanation Of Benefit records.</li>
<li>Consumer App generates and sends to the Health Plan's CARIN IG for Blue Button&reg; enabled FHIR API a request (which includes Patient ID, and token from the step #5) to fetch the Explanation Of Benefit (EOB) and supporting reference FHIR resources.</li>
<li>Health Plan's CARIN IG for Blue Button&reg; enabled FHIR API responds with a bundle of the requested EOB and supporting reference FHIR resources.</li>
<li>Consumer App presents the EOB and supporting reference FHIR resources to the Consumer.</li>
</ol>
