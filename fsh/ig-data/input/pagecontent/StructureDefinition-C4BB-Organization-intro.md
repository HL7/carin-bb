<h4 class="x_MsoNormal">Notes on Fields</h4>
<ul>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">The Organization FHIR Resource defines a comprehensive set of data elements.&nbsp; Many of them are not relevant to this use case.&nbsp; When reviewing the Profile Snapshot, several data elements previously hidden are now exposed.&nbsp; Fields intended for consideration to be provided in the API are marked as <a href="General_Guidance.html#must-support">Must Support</a>; i.e., a red <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ff0000;">S</span> or have a minimum cardinality of 1.&nbsp; All other data elements are not expected to be sent by a Requestor; if they are sent a Responder can choose to ignore them.</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">Payers may decide to provide either the data that was in effect as of the date of service or the current data<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.identifier[NPI]:&nbsp; Value is conditional depending on the Referring Resource.&nbsp; Populate Service Facility NPI with the value 'NPI has not been assigned' if an NPI has not been assigned to the Service Location Organization</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.address:&nbsp; Enter address of the location where the services were rendered.&nbsp; If the location is a component of the Billing Provider, do not populate this data element</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.meta.lastUpdated:&nbsp;Payers SHALL provide the last time the data was updated or the date of creation in the payerâ€™s system of record, whichever comes last.  Apps will use the meta.lastUpdated value to determine if the Reference resources are as of the current date or date of service. </li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">The numbers, e.g. (1), following the data element descriptions correlate to the MapID in the <a href="CPCDSDataDictionary.docx">CPCDS Data Dictionary</a> and the <a href="CPCDStoFHIRProfilesMapping.xlsx">Mapping Worksheet</a>&nbsp;as described&nbsp;<a href="Common_Payer_Consumer_Data_Set.html">here.</a></li>
