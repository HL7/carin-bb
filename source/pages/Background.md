# The CARIN Alliance
The [CARIN Alliance](https://www.carinalliance.com/) is a bi-partisan, multi-sector alliance convened by David Brailer, Aneesh Chopra, and Mike Leavitt, to unite industry leaders in advancing the adoption of consumer-directed health care information exchange across the U.S. 

We envision a future where any consumer can choose any application to retrieve both their complete health record and their complete coverage information from any provider or plan in the country. Specifically, we are promoting the ability for consumers and their authorized caregivers to gain digital access to their health information via non-proprietary application programming interfaces or APIs.

# The challenge with consumer-directed exchange
Consumer-directed exchange occurs when a consumer or an authorized caregiver invokes their HIPAA Individual Right of Access (45 CFR  164.524) and requests their digital health information from a HIPAA covered entity (CE) via an application or other third-party data steward.

Data from payers is not currently available to a consumer through an open API framework and therefore is not accessible by third party applications authorized by the consumer. 

No industry wide standard exists for Health Plans to send (adjudicated) Claims data to either Covered or Non-covered Entities

# Building on Blue Button 2.0 and Argonaut


The CARIN Blue Button Framework was designed to answer the challenge for health plans to 'meet or exceed' the [CMS Blue Button 2.0](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/) capabilities. The CMS Blue Button 2.0 project provides over 53 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries access to their electronic claims information. CMS is interested in health plans following their lead in sharing claims information with consumers.

A group of health plans  convened  to define what meet or exceed the capabilities of CMSs Blue Button 2.0 functionality means. The goal of the CARIN Alliance [Health Plan workgroup](https://www.carinalliance.com/our-work/health-plan/)  is to develop an agreed upon set of data fields to exchange with consumers and a FHIR-based implementation guide for health plans to use to implement the API. 

We used the [Argonaut Project](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) as a template for development of the CARIN Blue Button Framework. The Argonaut Project was formed in December 2014 as an implementation community comprising leading technology vendors and provider organizations to accelerate the use of FHIR and OAuth in health care information exchange. The Argonaut project is private-sector initiated and funded and works collaboratively with other FHIR initiatives to create open industry Implementation Guides in high priority use cases of importance to patients, providers and the industry as a whole. 

The CARIN workgroup is primarily centered around the data fields the industry would like to release to the consumer which would inform the future work of standards-based organizations.
