3. Terminology naming issues will be addressed during the ballot process and will be resolved prior to publication in the following way: the Value Sets will be updated to remove reference to CARIN Blue Button, replaced by either industry standard names or, for those specific to claim adjudication, with the new IG name.  Industry standard Code System revisions include consolidating the three Type of Bill Codes, removing reference to SNOMED CT, etc.  
4. Code System referencing issues will be addressed during the ballot process and will be resolved prior to publication. Based on recent guidance from the HL7 Vocabulary Workgroup a change will be made to reference external licensed Code Systems using URIs instead of OIDs.
