<ul>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">The EOB FHIR Resource defines a comprehensive set of data elements.&nbsp; Many of them are not relevant to this use case.&nbsp; When reviewing the Profile Snapshot, several data elements previously hidden are now exposed.&nbsp; Fields intended for consideration to be provided in the API are marked as <a href="General_Guidance.html#must-support">Must Support</a>; i.e., a red <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ff0000;">S</span> or have a minimum cardinality of 1.&nbsp; All other data elements are not expected to be sent by a Responder; if they are sent a Requestor can choose to ignore them</li>
<li>CPCDS data elements are mapped to EOB header or EOB.item data elements in alignment with claims submission standards.&nbsp; Line item amounts and amount types are to be provided in EOB.item.&nbsp; If a Payer does not have line item amounts, provide the claim amounts and amount types in the EOB header data elements.&nbsp; Total amounts, amount types and the in network or out of network payment status of the claim are to be provided in EOB.total.
