== Suppressed Messages ==
# The following code systems are external and not supported by terminology server 

# These are actual warnings to surpress, all relating to validation of values from terminologies

# informational -- these examples are in the IG because they are examples of the referenced profiles. 

# Suppress warning about Jira specification not being updated. This IG has CodeSystem and ValueSet names that are the same, which requires manually modifying the Jira Artifact names to avoid a conflict.

WARNING: The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG.  A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts.  To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jira-current.xml' (a normalized view of what is in Github) and 'template/jira-new.xml' (reflects current IG content)
