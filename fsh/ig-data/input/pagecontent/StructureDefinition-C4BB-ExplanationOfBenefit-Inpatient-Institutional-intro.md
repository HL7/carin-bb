<h4 class="x_MsoNormal">Notes on Fields</h4>
<ul>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">The EOB FHIR Resource defines a comprehensive set of data elements.&nbsp; Many of them are not relevant to this use case.&nbsp; When reviewing the Profile Snapshot, several data elements previously hidden are now exposed.&nbsp; Fields intended for consideration to be provided in the API are marked as <a href="General_Guidance.html#must-support">Must Support</a>; i.e., a red <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ff0000;">S</span> or have a minimum cardinality of 1.&nbsp; All other data elements are not expected to be sent by a Requestor; if they are sent a Responder can choose to ignore them.</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">CPCDS data elements are mapped to EOB header or EOB.item data elements in alignment with claims submission standards.&nbsp; Line item amounts and amount types are to be provided in EOB.item.&nbsp; If a Payer does not have line item amounts, provide the claim amounts and amount types in the EOB header data elements.&nbsp; Total amounts, amount types and the in network or out of network payment status of the claim are to be provided in EOB.total.</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">The determination of inpatient vs. outpatient institutional claims is defined by the Type of Bill. The NUBC manual defines which TOBs are inpatient vs outpatient.</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">A CPT / HCPCS code may not be available on an inpatient institutional claim. The cardinality of the HL7 base EOB Resource for item.productOrService is 1..1 if .item is provided.&nbsp; Since .item.revenue is required it means that item.productOrService must be populated.&nbsp; Since the profile is not able to relax the cardinality of the resource, it is recommended payers provide a data absent reason when a CPT / HCPCS code is not available.</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.diagnosis:&nbsp; ICD-10 / ICD-9 diagnosis codes are defined as CodeableConcepts</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.diagnosis.sequence rule:&nbsp; diagnosis.sequence values do not necessarily indiate any order in which the diagnosis was reported or identified.&nbsp; client app implementations should not assign any significance to the sequence values.&nbsp; client app implementations should use the values of diagnosis.type to identify primary, secondary, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.procedure:&nbsp; ICD-10 / ICD-9 procedure codes are defined as CodeableConcepts</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.procedure.sequence rule:&nbsp; procedure.sequence values do not necessarily indiate any order in which the procedure occurred.&nbsp; client app implementations should not assign any significance to the sequence values.&nbsp; client app implementations should use the values of procedure.type to identify primary and secondary procedures</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.supportingInfo[DRG]:&nbsp; DRGs require the DRG system; i.e., MS-DRG / AP-DRG / APR-DEG, the DRG version and the code value</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.adjudication.amount (populate only if item.adjudication is not available):&nbsp; Eligible amount = submitted amount - the noncovered amount - discount.&nbsp; The subscriber pays the member liability = deductible + coinsurance + copay + noncovered.&nbsp; (part of the member liability may have already been paid to the provider as paidbypatient). The eligible amount - the member liability is the payment amount to the provider (paidtoprovider) or the subscriber (paidtopatient)</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.item.adjudication.amount: &nbsp;Eligible amount = submitted amount - the noncovered amount - discount.&nbsp; The subscriber pays the member liability = deductible + coinsurance + copay + noncovered.&nbsp; (part of the member liability may have already been paid to the provider as paidbypatient). The eligible amount - the member liability is the payment amount to the provider (paidtoprovider) or the subscriber (paidtopatient)</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.total.amount:&nbsp; Eligible amount = submitted amount - the noncovered amount - discount.&nbsp; The subscriber pays the member liability = deductible + coinsurance + copay + noncovered.&nbsp; (part of the member liability may have already been paid to the provider as paidbypatient). The eligible amount - the member liability is the payment amount to the provider (paidtoprovider) or the subscriber (paidtopatient)</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">.total[inoutnetwork]:&nbsp; in network or out of network payment status for the claim</li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">The CPCDS data elements are defined in the data element comments.&nbsp; The numbers, e.g. (1), following the data element descriptions in the comments correlate to the MapID in the&nbsp;<a href="CPCDSDataDictionary.docx" >CPCDS Data Dictionary</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="CPCDStoFHIRProfilesMapping.xlsx">Mapping Worksheet</a>&nbsp;as described&nbsp;<a href="Common_Payer_Consumer_Data_Set.html">here.</a></li>
