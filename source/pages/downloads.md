**Full Implementation Guide**

The entire implementation guide (including the HTML files, definitions, validation information, etc.) may be downloaded [here](full-ig.zip).

**Validator Pack and Definitions:**

The validator.pack file is a zip file that contains all the value sets, profiles, extensions, list of pages and urls in the IG, etc defined as part of the this Implementation Guides.

It is used:
- by the validator if you refer to the IG directly by it's canonical URL
- by the IG publisher if you declare that one IG depends on another
- by a FHIR server, if you add the IG to server load list

You may [download the validator.pack file here](validator.pack).
